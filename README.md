# Omakase

The name is a reference to [a blog post by DHH](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/rails-is-omakase.html)
and the reference, and this very repository, was inspired by [a blog post by
Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/01/we-can-solve-multiple-default-stacks.html).

I'ma put my [Rails Application Templates](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html)
in here. Feel free to use them for whatever (see LICENSE for details).

## But... *How*?!?

Like so:

    $ rails new -m http://github.com/benhamill/omakase/... fix this later.
